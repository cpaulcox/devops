= Desktop with RDP

Not secure!!! Change the password!

== Building and Running

* `docker build -t desktop .`
* `docker run --name mydesktop -d desktop` this only allows access onto the container's IP `docker inspect mydesktop` use -p to access from the host
* `docker exec -it mydesktop bash` and `ps aux` to check that the xrdp and xrdp-sesman are both running.

Uses `tail -f /dev/null` to keep the daemon container running.
