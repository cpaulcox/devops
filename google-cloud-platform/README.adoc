== GCP

=== Bootstrap

In the GCP console:

. Create a service account
. Create an f1-micro in us-east1 with name `bootstrap`
. Associate the instance with the service account and label with key `keep` and value `true` to avoid deletion.
. Launch the instance and ssh via the GCP console

Inside the bootstrap instance:

----
apt-get install -y git unzip

wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.11.11/terraform_0.11.11_linux_amd64.zip
unzip terraform_0.11.11_linux_amd64.zip
rm terraform_0.11.11_linux_amd64.zip

# Download the GCP provider
./terraform init

./terraform apply
----

The provider credentials (that in examples reference `account.json` aren't required, presumably, because terraform uses the instance's associated service account.
